# Financial Research Repository

Welcome! This repo is my personal hub for all the websites I use when digging into markets, research, and ETFs.  
Instead of juggling bookmarks across browsers and devices, everything lives here in one place.

👉 The full list is in [`financial_repository/links.md`](https://github.com/tanmaychandane/etc/blob/main/financial_repository/links.md).  
Open it, click the site you need, and you’re off.

## Why this exists
- I got tired of hunting for links every time I switched devices.
- Sharing bookmarks with others was clunky—this way it’s just one URL.
- It’s simple: one page, all links, grouped by category.

---

## How to use it
- Head straight to [`links.md`](https://github.com/tanmaychandane/etc/blob/main/financial_repository/links.md).
- Use your browser’s **Find** (Ctrl/Command + F) if you’re looking for something specific.
- Share the repo link with anyone who might find it useful. They’ll have read-only access.

## Contributing / Updating
This is mostly for my own workflow, but if you spot a broken link or have a great resource worth adding:
- Fork the repo and send a pull request, or
- Just ping me with the link.

## Final note
This isn’t meant to be fancy—it’s a practical bookmark list dressed up in Markdown.  
If it saves me (and maybe you) a few clicks each day, it’s doing its job.
